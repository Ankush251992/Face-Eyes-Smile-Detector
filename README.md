# Face, Eyes, and Smile Detection using OpenCV

## Project Description
This project uses Haar cascades to perform real-time face, eyes, and smile detection from a live video stream.

## Installation Instructions

1. **Download this project folder to your local machine.**

2. **Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.**

3. **Install the required Python packages.**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Python script to start face, eyes, and smile detection.**
    ```bash
    python CodeDepot_opencv_haar_cascades.py
    ```

2. **A window displaying the live video stream will open.** The program will identify faces, eyes, and smiles, highlighting them with colored rectangles.

3. **To exit the program, press the 'q' key.**
